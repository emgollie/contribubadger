## Rough roadmap

this is for illustration purposes only at this point.

### Heartbeat ending May 30

* badgekit hosted on badgeapi.allizom.org (or something), webmaker switches to it
* Sean Martell's visual templates integrated into badge studio
* we have a plan for display on Mozillians.org (rough API?)

### Heartbeat ending June 13

* Badges.mozilla.org shows signs of life (first meaningful changes are live)
* Mozillians.org can display badgeapi badges in staging or dev environment

### Heartbeat ending June 27

* MDN can push badges to badgeapi for pickup by mozillians
